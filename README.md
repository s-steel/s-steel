When I'm not programming, you can find me camping, and hiking with my wife and two dogs.  I also love to dabble in photography and woodworking.


### I'm currently learning:
- Python / Flask
- Docker
- JavaScript / Node.JS
- Currently looking for new opportunities

### Get in touch with me! 📣
I'm always looking to meet new people and chat!
